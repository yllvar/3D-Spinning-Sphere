# 🌟 Interactive 3D Background with Cursor Follower

> Create stunning interactive 3D backgrounds for modern web applications

## 🎯 Project Overview

A dynamic and engaging 3D background implementation using Three.js and React Three Fiber in a Next.js application. Features an interactive particle system and a sleek 3D cursor follower that responds to user movements in real-time.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Built with cutting-edge web technologies:

* **Next.js** - App Router for powerful server-side rendering
* **React** - Component-based UI architecture
* **Three.js** - Professional 3D graphics rendering
* **React Three Fiber** - Seamless Three.js integration with React
* **@react-three/drei** - Essential Three.js helpers and abstractions

## 🧩 Core Components

### AnimatedBackground (`components/AnimatedBackground.tsx`)

Creates an immersive particle field with:
* Dynamic particle positioning and movement
* Cursor-responsive interaction
* Simplex Noise for organic movement
* Optimized performance for large particle systems

### CursorFollower (`components/CursorFollower.tsx`)

Implements an interactive 3D cursor with:
* Smooth physics-based cursor tracking
* Dynamic color transitions
* Mouse wheel zoom functionality
* Custom shader effects
